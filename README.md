# WaitWhile Macro

## What it does

This is a simple Swift Macro that grows out of a common pattern I find myself using a lot, now that I've adopted Swift Testing.

Let's say your unit test calls some app code that does something that takes some time, like, for example, this button action code that tells a processor to dismiss a view controller:

````swift
    /// Done button action.
    @IBAction func doDone(_ sender: Any) {
        Task {
            await processor?.receive(.dismissPurchase)
        }
    }
````

To test it, we mock the processor, call `doDone`, and look to see that the mock processor received the `.dismissPurchase` message. Fine. But there's a problem: if we simply write the test this way, it fails:

````swift
    @Test("doDone sends dismissPurchase")
    func doDone() async {
        subject.processor = mockProcessor
        subject.doDone(self)
        #expect(mockProcessor.messagesReceived.contains(.dismissPurchase))
    }
````

The reason for the failure is the `Task` call in the `doDone` routine. This causes a slight delay. We need somehow to _wait_ until the `.dismissPurchase` message is sent.

Now, what I was doing to solve this problem was to look repeatedly at the state of the mock processor in a `while` loop, calling `Task.yield()`, like this:

````swift
    @Test("doDone sends dismissPurchase")
    func doDone() async {
        subject.processor = mockProcessor
        subject.doDone(self)
        while mockProcessor.messagesReceived.isEmpty {
            await Task.yield()
        }
        #expect(mockProcessor.messagesReceived.contains(.dismissPurchase))
    }
````

That works great. But I was doing that _a lot_. So I wanted to embody that pattern as a macro, analogous from the caller's point of view to Swift Testing's `#expect`. With my macro, that same code is written like this:

````swift
    @Test("doDone sends dismissPurchase")
    func doDone() async {
        subject.processor = mockProcessor
        subject.doDone(self)
        await #while(mockProcessor.messagesReceived.isEmpty)
        #expect(mockProcessor.messagesReceived.contains(.dismissPurchase))
    }
````

That's all there is to it! It's a very simple macro, very simply written; I didn't do any of the clever stuff that Apple does with `#expect` behind the scenes.

## Future directions

I'd like to add a timeout, because if you make a `while` loop whose condition is never met, the test currently doesn't fail â€” it just hangs. I think I see how to do this, but once I had the macro working well enough to adopt in my own code, I stopped working on it for now. So that's left as a future direction.
